This repository contains the curricular work for CS410 Data Mining and Machine Learning on Graphs.

Assignment 1:

This assignment covers conceptual understanding of networks, network attributes, random graph construction, degree distibution, degree centrality, graph visualization and other graph related concepts.
This assignment was partially written and partially coded. My code is contained in ./Assignment1. Instructions are provided in the README of that directory.

Assignment 2: 

This assignment covers Node Classification over datasets with varying homophily and hyper-parameter tuning for a recommender system.
	- Question 1:
		i. Requires the construction of several models (MLP, Label Propagation, GNN) to achieve node classification. 
		ii. Requires the construction of the Stochastic Block Model to generate networks with varying homophily.
	- Question 2:
		i. Uses the RecBole library to load existing models and tune hyperparameters to achieve higher accuracies.

Final Project:

My final project took a deep dive into experimentation with different models for the task of node-classification. I created various architectures for various graph-based models and analyzed performance on datasets with high homophily. I created a report to summarize my procedure and findings.
